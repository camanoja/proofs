# A Quick Introduction to Proofs
## Paper Goal
To provide an _accessible_ and easy-to-digest introduction to proof structure. This paper should be readable for anyone who has completed high-school math.

This paper should be challenging to the point where passing the challenge is gratifying, but not frustrating. This paper must respect the intelligence of the reader and not be condescending.

## Preliminaries
 - Conventions
  - assigning a number to a letter


 - Addition / Multiplication properties
 - Properties of Equality
  - Transitivity, Reflexivity, Symmetry
  - Examples: 1 = 2/2 = 3/3
 - Sum notation
 - Sets N and R
 - Theorems vs. Lemmas vs. Corollaries

## Introduction
- What are Proofs?
  * A tool for truth
  * A product of philosophy; deeper than the mathematics that perhaps we are led to believe
  * Allows us to explore the field of mathematics given fundamental tools


- Various styles of Proofs:
* Different ways of looking at the problem
  * *Direct Proofs* - proofs that reflect the structure of the statement to be proved
  * *Indirect Proofs* - proofs that do not reflect such a structure; proves a statement that is logically equivalent the statement to be proved.
    - e.g. To show that if there is a number with a factor of two, then it cannot be even; we can equivalently say that if a number is even then it must have a factor of two.

## Direct Proofs
- Regular Statements
- Conditionals

## Indirect Proofs
- _Reductio ad absurdum_
- Proof by Contradiction
- Proof by Contrapositive



## A Special Direct Proof Method - Induction
 - A formal intuition behind induction – using information that you know to achieve the desired result (“Since n = 1 implies n = 2, and n = 2 implies n = 3 …, etc.”)
    * Dominoes
- Defining the proof by a familiar example:
  - Constant Sum Formula
  - Linear Sum Formula
    - In a different style: proving that the sum of consecutive odd numbers equal a square
    - Corollary: Linear Sum

- Predicates/Statements
- Defining a relevant subset of
- Base Cases
- Induction Hypothesis
- Induction Step


- Aside: What _is_ Induction?
    - Philosophical Definition
    - Induction vs. Deduction


 - Aside: A proof of (Simple) Induction – creating from the Principle of Well-Ordering (Appendix)
    - Proof by Contradiction – an indirect method

- Aside: Why Induction works on N and not Z

## Conclusion/Questions
- A note on elegance with proofs
    * If there’s an easier way that uses less machinery, its probably better to use it
    * However, some proofs _require_ the development of new mathematical "technologies"; this is innovation; consider derivatives
    * A note on the Clay Institute problems: Poincare conjecture and Perelman


- Question: Squared Sums, Cubed Sums
- Challenge:  shape
- Theorem: Fundamental Theorem of Algebra


## Highlighted Proofs

- Derivative of e^x; alternative form
- Binomial Expansion Theorem/ or Pascal’s Triangle Thm,
- Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
