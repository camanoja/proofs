# A simple introduction to proofs

3 Proofs: Summation, Binomial Expansion Theorem/ or Pascal’s Triangle Thm, Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
Introduction
    • Review on various types of Proofs
        ◦ Direct Proofs – proofs that reflect the structure of the statement to be proved
        ◦ Indirect Proofs – proofs that do not reflect such a structure; proves a statement that logically implies the statement to be proved

    • Mathematical Induction and its uses
        ◦ Definition: What is Induction?
            ▪ Scientific Definition
            ▪ Induction vs. Deduction

        ◦ “An extended/infinite proof by cases”
        ◦ A proof of (Simple) Induction – creating  from the Principle of Well-Ordering (Appendix)
            ▪ Proof by Contradiction – an indirect method
            ▪
    • (Why Induction works on , and not )
Body
    • The relationship between Induction and a proof by induction
        ◦ A formal intuition behind induction – using information that you know to achieve the desired result (“Since n = 1 implies n = 2, and n = 2 implies n = 3 …, etc.”)
        ◦ Dominoes
    • Defining the proof by a familiar example -
    • Predicates/Statements
    • Defining a relevant subset of
    • Base Cases
    • Induction Hypothesis
    • Induction Step

Conclusion/Questions
    • A note on elegance with proofs
        ◦ If there’s an easier way that uses less machinery, its probably better to use it
    • Question: Squared Sums, Cubed Sums
    • Challenge:  shape
    • Theorem: Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
