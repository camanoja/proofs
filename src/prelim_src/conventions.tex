  % assigning a number to a letter
  \subsubsection{Assigning a Number to a Letter}
  The mathematical statement:
  $$x = 2.2$$
  \textbf{assigns} the number $2.2$ to the letter $x$, and allows us to use $x$
  in place of $2.2$. If we expect the value of $x$ to take on different values,
  then we call $x$ a variable. If we require the value of $x$ to stay the same,
  then we call $x$ a constant.

  This notation is especially useful if we want to store the effect of an
  operation without explicitly calculating it. This allows us a simple yet
  powerful freedom to algebraically manipulate our values:

  \begin{expl}{Variable Manipulation}
    Let $a = p/q$ and $b = r/s$ where $q, r, s$ are not equal to $0$.
    We wish to find the value of $a \div b$. Assign $D = a/b$. We have:
    \begin{align}
      D       &= a/b \\
      bD      &= p/q     & \justify{multiplying both sides by $b$}\\
      (r/s)D  &= p/q \\
      rD      &= p/q \cdot s, &\justify{multiplying both sides by $s$} \\
      D       &= (p/q) \cdot (s/r) & \justify{multiplying by $1/r$}
    \end{align}

    So $\displaystyle{\frac{p}{q} \div \frac{r}{s} =
     \frac{p}{q} \cdot \frac{s}{r}}$,
    as expected.
    \begin{comment}
    We wish to find the value of the infinitely nested square root
    $\sqrt{6\sqrt{6 \sqrt{6 ...}}}$. Let $x = \sqrt{6\sqrt{6 \sqrt{6 ...}}}$.
    Then:
    \begin{align*}
      x^2 &= 6 \sqrt{6 \sqrt{6 ...}} \\
      x^2 &= 6x \\
      x^2 - 6x &= 0 \\
      x(x-6) &= 0
    \end{align*}

    So either $x=0$ or $x=6$. Since
    $\sqrt{6 \sqrt{6 ...}} > \sqrt{6 \sqrt{0}} = 0$ we must have that $x = 6$.
    \end{comment}
  \end{expl}

  \subsubsection{Assigning a Mathematical Object to a Letter}
  In the same way as numbers, we can also use variables to refer to
  mathematical objects other than numbers. We may say that $x = (2, 9)$,
  $y = 5 + 3i$, $z = f$ (where $f(x) = x^2$), et cetera.

  \subsubsection{Quantifiers}
  % like a game
  % for all - meaning someone can choose any value
  % there exists - meaning we choose that value
  % such that : "with the property"

  % on language; common phrases
  % holds/does not hold
  % ``we have"
  % it follows that
