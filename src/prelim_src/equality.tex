\section{Properties of Equality}
Suppose that two mathematical objects (numbers, ordered pairs, matrices,
...) $a$ and $b$ are equal. We express this as $a = b$.

Then, we assume that the following statements are true:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item If $a = b$ and $b = c$, then $a = c$. This property is called
  \textbf{transitivity}.
  \item If $a = b$ then $b = a$. This property is called \textbf{symmetry}.
  \item $a = a$ ($a$ is equal to itself). This property is called
  \textbf{reflexivity}.
\end{enumerate}
