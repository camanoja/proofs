\section{Operator Properties}
Let $\op$ denote some operation on a set of one or more mathematical
objects $S$. Let $x, y, z \in S$.

% unary, binary, ternary operations
If $\op x$ is a valid operation, then we call $\op$ a unary operator. If
$x \op y$ is a valid operation, then we call $\op$ a binary operator.

% associativity

% reflexivity

% transitivity


\section{Operative Closure}
We say that a set $S$ is \textbf{closed} under a certain operation if for
\emph{any} two elements $a, b \in S$, the resulting object $c$ that is the
result of the operation between $a$ and $b$ \emph{is also} in $S$. The
following properties are true:

\begin{itemize}
  \item $\naturals$ is closed under addition and multiplication, but not
  subtraction and division.
  \item $\ints$ is closed under addition, multiplication and subtraction, but
  not division.
\end{itemize}

$\naturals$ is not closed under subtraction, as
$(8) - (9) = -1 \not \in \naturals$ and $\ints$ is not closed under division
as $(3) \div (2) = 1.5 \not\in \ints$.
