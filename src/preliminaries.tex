  \subsection{Number Sets}{\label{subsec: defnumbersets}}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The set $\naturals = \toset{0, 1, 2, ...}$ is called the natural
    number set.
    \item The set $\ints = \toset{ ..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ... }$ is called
    the integer set.
    \item The set of all numbers that are equal to a ratio of any two
    integers $\rationals = \toset{p/q : p, q \in \ints, q \neq 0}$ is called
    the rational number set.
    \item The set of all numbers that are not equal to any ratio of two
    integers $\irrationals = \toset{..., \phi, \sqrt{2}, e, \pi, ...}$ is
    called the irrational number set.
    \item The combined set of the rationals and irrationals
    $\reals = \rationals \cup \irrationals$ is called the real number set.
  \end{itemize}
